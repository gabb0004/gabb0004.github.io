<p>This portfolio has challenged me to use everything that I have learned this semester, from specifity all the way to CSS grid and flexbox. It's a very challenging task, but I can comfortably say that I can code any basic website from scratch and have a good final product. I've learned that I overestimated my coding skill from the beginning of this semester. I think that I am good at HTML and CSS, but nowhere good enough to where i can code a final assignment in a day or two. I know now that I have to give myself the time to do the work and that I don't have the necessary skills to do things last minute.<p>
